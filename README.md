Welcome!

This sample project contains Code Quality Sample demonstrating my experience with C#, OOPs, SOLID principles, TDD, Unit Testing & Mocking. (You can view the CodingTest.docx for more information)

I am a Passionate C# Developer + Architect with 15+ years of experience.  I have been experienced in both Project & Product Development methodologies.  Being a Passioante C# Programmer I have written an ebook "Design Patterns in C#" available in Amazon https://amzn.to/2yLDJ0X.
